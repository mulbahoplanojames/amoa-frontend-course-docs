HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a widely used standard markup language for creating webpages. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1991, with its first version, "HTML 1.0," released in 1993. The first official standard specification, "HTML 2.0," followed in 1995.

This HTML tutorial encompasses a comprehensive range of topics, from fundamental concepts and basic tags to more advanced techniques, including forms, modal boxes, multimedia, and HTML5. It is designed to assist both beginners and experienced designers in mastering the skills needed to create dynamic and responsive websites.

### What is HTML?

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a standard markup language used to design the structure of a webpage. It combines the concepts of HyperText, which refers to the internal links between webpages, and Markup Language, which dictates the layout and presentation of text and media.

### Basic HTML Structure

The fundamental structure of an HTML document consists of several essential tags that are required to create a webpage. Adhering to this structure is necessary for developing any type of HTML document.

Below is the basic structure of an HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Webpage's Heading</h1>
    <p>Content (Your first paragraph).</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Elements of HTML Basic Structure

The following are the essential tags that make up the basic structure of an HTML document:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`

   This declaration defines the document type as HTML and must be included at the beginning of any HTML document.

2. `<html>...</html>`

   The `<html>` tag serves as the parent tag for all HTML elements. All content related to the HTML document, including CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, must be enclosed within this tag.

3. `<head>...</head>`

   The `<head>` tag acts as a container for elements that are not directly displayed on the webpage but are essential for its functionality. This includes meta tags (used for SEO), the title tag, script tags, and more.

4. `<title>...</title>`

   The `<title>` tag defines the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's tab, bookmarks list, and search engine results. This tag is crucial for SEO, as it helps search engines understand the content of the webpage.

5. `<body>...</body>`

   The `<body>` tag contains all the elements that represent the main content of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser.

6. `<h1>...</h1>`

   The `<h1>` tag is one of the heading tags and is the most significant, defining the main title or headline of the webpage. Any text enclosed within `<h1>` and `</h1>` is considered a top-level heading.

7. `<p>...</p>`
   The `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph. Any text placed between `<p>` and `</p>` will be displayed as a paragraph on the webpage. Multiple `<p>` tags can be used to separate text into different paragraphs.

### Writing "Hello World" in HTML

Using the basic HTML structure outlined earlier, we can create an HTML document that displays "Hello World" on a webpage.

Here is the HTML code to show "Hello World" in a heading:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

The example above will render "Hello, World!" in the browser as a top-level heading `(<h1>)`.

### Comments in HTML

Similar to other programming languages, you can include comments in an HTML document. To create a comment in HTML, use the syntax `<!-- to start the comment and -->` to end it.

Any text placed between `<!-- and -->` is treated as a comment and will not be displayed on the website.
Example

Here is an example of an HTML comment:

```
<!-- This is a comment and will not be displayed on the webpage -->
```

### Creating an HTML Document

An HTML document is a file that contains HTML code and has a ".htm" or ".html" extension. To create an HTML document, you will need a text editor, and to view it, you will require a web browser.

Here are the steps to create an HTML document:

- Open a text editor.
- Write your HTML code.
- Save the file with a ".htm" or ".html" extension.

Finally, you can open the file in a browser by typing the file name along with its complete path, or by right-clicking the file and selecting "Open with" to choose a browser.

### Why Learn HTML?

HTML was originally developed to define the structure of documents, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists, to facilitate the sharing of scientific information among researchers. Today, HTML is widely used to format web pages using various tags available in the language.

Learning HTML is essential for students and professionals aspiring to become proficient software engineers, particularly in the field of web development.
