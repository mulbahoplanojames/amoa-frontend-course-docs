HTML tags are the fundamental elements used to define the structure of an HTML document. They are represented by letters or words enclosed in angle brackets (< and >). Most HTML tags consist of an opening tag and a closing tag, and each tag has a specific meaning. The browser interprets these tags and displays the content accordingly.

For instance, when text is wrapped in a paragraph tag (<p></p>), the browser displays it as a separate paragraph. In this tutorial, we will discuss various basic HTML tags.

### Heading Tags

Heading tags are used to define the headings of documents. HTML provides six levels of headings, which are represented by the elements `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, and `<h6>`. When displayed, the browser adds one line before and one line after each heading.

Example:

The following HTML code demonstrates various levels of headings:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Heading Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>

    <h2>This is heading 2</h2>

    <h3>This is heading 3</h3>

    <h4>This is heading 4</h4>

    <h5>This is heading 5</h5>

    <h6>This is heading 6</h6>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Paragraph Tag

The `<p>` tag is used to structure text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph should be enclosed between an opening `<p>` tag and a closing `</p>` tag.

Example:

The following example demonstrates the use of the paragraph tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Paragraph Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Here is the first paragraph of text.</p>

    <p>Here is the second paragraph of text.</p>

    <p>Here is the third paragraph of text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Line Break Tag

The `<br />` tag is used to insert a line break. It is an empty element, meaning it does not require an opening and closing tag, as there is no content to place between them.

Example:

The following example demonstrates the use of the line break tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Line Break Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>
      Hello<br />
      You delivered your assignment on time.<br />

      Thanks<br />
      Mahnaz
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Image Tag

The `<img>` tag is used to display images on a webpage. It requires a `src` attribute, which specifies the URL of the image, and an `alt` attribute, which provides alternative text for the image.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Image Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <img src="https://example.com/image.jpg" alt="Example Image" />
  </body>
</html>
```

### List Tag

The `<ul>` tag is used to create an unordered list, and the `<ol>` tag is used to create an ordered list. Each list item should be enclosed between an opening `<li>` tag and a closing `</li>` tag.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>List Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Anchor Tag

The `<a>` tag is used to create hyperlinks, which connect one webpage to another. It requires a `href` attribute, which specifies the URL of the destination page.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Anchor Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Example</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Horizontal Rule Tag

The `<hr />` tag is used to create a horizontal rule, which is a line that spans the width of the page. It is an empty element, meaning it does not require an opening and closing tag, as there is no content to place between them.

Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Horizontal Rule Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>First paragraph</p>
    <hr />
    <p>Second paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Conclusion
