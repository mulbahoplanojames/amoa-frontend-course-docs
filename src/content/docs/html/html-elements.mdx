HTML elements are the basic building blocks used to create a web page. Each element is formed by an opening tag, content, and a closing tag.

### What is an HTML Element?

An HTML element is a fundamental component of an HTML document that can contain data to be displayed on a webpage, such as text, images, links, or sometimes nothing at all. An HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, with the opening tag potentially including attributes.

An HTML element includes:

- Opening Tag: Specifies the beginning of the element and may include multiple attributes.
- Content: The information to be displayed or processed within the element.
- Closing Tag: Marks the end of the element (the closing tag may be optional for some elements).

An HTML document is structured as a tree of HTML elements, which define the content and layout of a webpage, determining how and what content is displayed in different sections.
Example of HTML Elements

Here are some examples of HTML elements:

```html
<p>This is paragraph content.</p>

<h1>This is heading content.</h1>

<div>This is division content.</div>
```

The following table illustrates the different parts (opening tag, content, and closing tag) of the HTML elements used in the above example:

| Opening Tag | Content                    | Closing Tag |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| `<p>`       | This is paragraph content. | `</p>`      |
| `<h1>`      | This is heading content.   | `</h1>`     |
| `<div>`     | This is division content.  | `</div>`    |

In this case, `<p>...</p>` is an HTML element, and `<h1>...</h1>` is another HTML element.

### HTML Element Structure

The structure of an HTML element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. This structure is essential for defining how elements are displayed on a webpage.

### HTML Elements vs. Tags

HTML elements are created using HTML tags. An HTML element is defined by a pair of starting and closing tags that enclose content, which defines the content and structure of the webpage. In contrast, HTML tags are the keywords that are part of HTML elements and are enclosed in angle brackets `(<>)`.

For example, `<p>` is the starting tag of a paragraph, and `</p>` is the closing tag of the same paragraph, while `<p>This is a paragraph</p>` represents a complete paragraph element.

### Nested HTML Elements

HTML allows for the nesting of elements, which means you can place one or more HTML elements inside another HTML element. The outer element is considered the parent element, while the inner elements are the child elements. You can have multiple levels of nesting, but there are some guidelines to follow:

- Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag.
- The closing tag of the parent element must come after the closing tag of the child element.
- The nested elements must be valid HTML elements.

Example:

In the following example, we nest the italicized element `<i>...</i>` within the `<h1>` element and the underline `<u>...</u>` element within the paragraph element:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Nested Elements Example</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>This is <i>italic</i> heading</h1>

    <p>This is <u>underlined</u> paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

When executed, this example will display two sentences where one HTML element is nested within another.

Note: In the above example, the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags are also considered nested elements, as they contain one or more elements inside them.

### HTML Void Elements

HTML void elements are those that do not require closing tags. These elements do not have a content model and do not allow for nesting. Void elements are also known as empty or self-closing elements.

Some examples of void elements include `<img />`, `<hr />`, and `<br />`. The following table lists some common void elements:

| S.No | Element & Description                                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `<img /> - Used for inserting images within HTML documents.`            |
| 2    | `<hr /> - Displays a horizontal rule.`                                  |
| 3    | `<br /> - Provides a line break.`                                       |
| 4    | `<source /> - Used for embedding media resources like audio and video.` |

### Are HTML Elements Case-Sensitive?

No, HTML elements are not case-sensitive, meaning you can write HTML elements in either uppercase or lowercase. However, it is not considered good practice to mix cases, as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends using lowercase for tag names.

Example:

In the following example, we write HTML elements (tag names) in uppercase and mixed case. The output will still be correct, and the HTML code will run without errors:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
  <body>
    <p>
      HTML is not case sensitive; we can use both upper and lower case letters
      in the tags.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, despite the use of uppercase letters, the HTML document will render correctly. However, it is advisable to stick to lowercase for consistency and adherence to best practices.

### Conclusion

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML documents, and understanding them is essential for creating and managing webpages. This tutorial has covered the basic concepts of HTML elements, including the structure of an HTML element, attributes, and optional closing tags. By mastering these concepts, you can create well-structured and visually appealing webpages.
